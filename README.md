# Yellow
## Yellow is a movie reviews website which has a Java + Spring Boot backend along with a ReactJS frontend. For persisting the data, I have used MongoDB as the database.
## This full stack project provides me a good understanding of REST APIs using Spring Boot and the various annotations in it which allow boilerplate code to be injected very easily.
